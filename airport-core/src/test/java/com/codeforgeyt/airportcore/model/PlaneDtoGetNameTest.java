================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The method getName() is public and returns the value of a private attribute directly. If the 'name' attribute contains sensitive data, it can be exposed to any class in the application.
Solution: You should use proper access control for sensitive data. If 'name' attribute contains sensitive data, consider adding additional security measures such as encryption or data masking.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Encapsulation (CWE-668)
Issue: The 'name' attribute is directly accessible by the getName() method without any validation or control. This could allow inappropriate modification or access of the 'name' attribute.
Solution: Consider implementing encapsulation correctly. Encapsulate the 'name' attribute properly and provide controlled access through getter and setter methods. Also, consider adding validation checks in the setter method.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate the return of the correct name

Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsCorrectName
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the getName method returns the correct name as set in the object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known name.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name is equal to the known name set in the object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName method returns the correct name. This is the expected result as the getName method should return the name set in the object. This test is significant as it ensures that the getName method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the return of null when no name is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsNullWhenNoNameIsSet
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the getName method returns null when no name is set in the object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object without setting a name.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName method returns null when no name is set. This is the expected result as the getName method should return null if no name is set in the object. This test is significant as it ensures that the getName method handles the scenario where no name is set correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the return of an empty string when the name is set as an empty string

Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsEmptyStringWhenNameIsEmpty
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the getName method returns an empty string when the name is set as an empty string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with the name set as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName method returns an empty string when the name is set as such. This is the expected result as the getName method should return the name set in the object, even if it is an empty string. This test is significant as it ensures that the getName method handles the scenario where the name is an empty string correctly.
